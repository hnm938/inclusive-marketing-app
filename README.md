### About the Challenge

For the first challenge in the course in module 1, we had to debug & refactor code.

After removing repeating unless code, changing tags and cleaning up the code

I decided to overhaul the CSS, not that it was a requirement for the challenge

but it was a fun and enjoyable task.
